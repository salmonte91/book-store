# Boom Book Library

The Boom Book Library is your one stop shop for finding your next adventure within the comfort and safety of your favorite novel. This project was created with React and uses technologies such as Material MUI and Google Books API. 

We carefully selected the technologies used in this app based on our extensive knowledge and experience with each of them. In the past we built applications that relied on the use of an API so we decided a bookstore app that used a database of books would be the perfect fit. We knew that these tools would be the perfect fit to meet all of our expectations for the project. 

When you first visit our application you'll be greeted by the welcome page. We have a search  form to help you find your desired book, a welcome message from us for you to read, as well as a footer giving you more information about our store and background.

While we were able to complete a fully operational application, as with any development process, we faced several challenges along the way. Some of them were very basic from CSS styling issues to much more complex ones such as our information not being fetched properly from the API we're using. As developers, it's our job to understand and overcome these obstacles to ensure that the app functions optimally.
